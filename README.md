I'm a web developer based in China, a lot of my open source work is focusing on making web development easier, which is probably why you're here.

If my code has helped you, please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/egoist). If you need more help than I can offer in issues, or you need help with private code, you can [contact me](mailto:0x142857@gmail.com) to discuss paid work.

## What I'm up to

Currently I'm focusing on making [Ream](https://github.com/ream/ream) production ready, it's a SSR framework for Vue 3. 

## Let's talk

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_egoistlily). DMs are open if want to talk 😊
